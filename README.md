# Insurance Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project is a part of the Data Management course for the Masters of Data Science and Analytics at UKM. 
The objective is to demonstrate data management, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and exploration skills using a real-world dataset. I'm currently in the Insurance industry and I aspire to continue working in this industry upon completing my Masters program.
The analysis here is to identify the relationship between demographic and lifestyle factors (such as age, sex and BMI) and medical insurance premium charged.

## Dataset Source
The chosen dataset is accessible at Github at https://github.com/stedy/Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets/blob/master/insurance.csv from the Machine Learning with R dataset repository.

### Features
- 'age' represents the age of the insured 
- 'sex' represents the gender of the insured 
- 'bmi' represents the Body Mass Index of the insured 
- 'children' represents the number of dependents of the insured
- 'smoker' represents the smoking status of the insured
- 'region' represents the residential area of the insured in United States
- 'charges' is the premium charged by life insurance company towards the insured

## Tools and Technologies
**Python(Jupyter Notebook)**
**Pandas** - for data manipulation
**Matplotlib and Seaborn** - for visualization
**Github** - for version control and publishing
**Apache Hive** - for data processing

## Repository contents
## Project Sections
### 1. Data Cleaning
- Checked and handled missing values
- Converted categorical data to numerical format
- Removed or encoded non-numeric entries for categorical analysis

### 2. Data Visualization
- Distribution plots of BMI, Age, Charges
- Correlation Heatmap
- Boxplot of Charges by Smoker Status and Region
- Pair plots for key features

### 3. Insights and Explanations
- Smoking significantly increases insurance charges
- Higher BMI correlates with higher medical costs
- Age and Charges show positive correlation

### 4. Recommendations
- Encourage wellness programs targeting smokers and high-BMI individuals
- Consider age-based risk adjustment in premium calculation
- Region specific insurance pricing on healthcare usage

### 5. Conclusion
- This analysis provides key insights into factors affecting insurance charges. These insights can help life insurance companies to optimize pricing strategies and risk models.
