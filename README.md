# Insurance Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project is a part of the Data Management course for the Masters of Data Science and Analytics at UKM. 
The objective is to demonstrate data management, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and exploration skills using a real-world dataset. I'm currently in the Insurance industry and I aspire to continue working in this industry upon completing my Masters program.
The analysis here is to identify the relationship between demographic and lifestyle factors (such as age, sex and BMI) and medical insurance premium charged.
